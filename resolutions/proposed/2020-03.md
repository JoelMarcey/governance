# TODO Group Steering Committee
## Resolution 2020-03
## Status: Proposed on 2020-11-16

## Subject: Suggested changes for Steering Committee member selection

At the meeting of the Steering Committee of the TODO Group on YYYY-MM-DD, the following resolution
was reviewed and adopted by the committee:

We will amend the [organisation charter](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/master/CHARTER.adoc) to clarify the dates and timings of the election and terms of both elected and appointed steering committee members. A summary of the proposed changes:

* Specify appointed member terms start on February 1 and last 2 years
* Provide more flexibility in the nomination/election timing (Sept-Nov
instead of Sept only)
* Specify appointments happen at start of year after newly elected
member terms begin

The proposed changes to the charter are in commit 112872ee1db230c2228c56acfe264a35f976efff, contained in Pull Request #90.

Resolved:

WHEREAS, the charter of the TODO Group, dated 2020-11-16, empowers the Steering Committee to amend the organisation charter with a two-thirds majority of all now-serving Steering Committee members;

That the committee {approves/declines the proposed action}.
