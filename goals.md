# TODO Strategic Goals

As a result of the discussion from September's Steering Committee meeting, a set of strategic goals for 2021 H2 were defined and commented in the following deck:

* TBD: Strategic goals deck 2022 H1
* [Strategic goals deck 2021 H2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IWFi7SMFBpjRq6xkaAu0dnsrDJ4KKCuTVj0HGA_uUyg/edit?usp=sharing)

Based on this, we would like to bring the goals to the TODO Group for review and sign-off by the Steering Committee in order to let the TODO Group shape the program and execute.

The goals will be revisited and updated for each half first and the second year.
